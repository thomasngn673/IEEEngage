How to make this scalabble?
- How to ask for excel sheet as an input 
 - ans: Server gonna give us dataframe
Are we going to create a new program for each and then code it?


DATA VISUILIZATION 

- bar graph what and how displayed
   - Speak with gnat on what you need from program to dispaly 
   - What kind of graphs do we want 
       - Event type vs attendance 
            - what percent of people attend the first general meeting , then second general meeting. 

Ideas: 

create indiviual functions for each part for easier access

FOR CHRIS REMINDER: 
Add a member ship pt column - How much the event it worth
- Able to refer to timmy and it adds up all the events he went to 


TO DO: 

Put things in indivual functions to run calculations 

figure out what type of graphs . How to display bar graph for example
- Variation of bar graphs
